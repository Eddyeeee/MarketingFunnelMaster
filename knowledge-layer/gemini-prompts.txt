## API Call Instructions

### Batch Processing
1. Process 2-3 pages per API call to maintain context
2. Start with table of contents to identify priority chapters
3. Focus on chapters with "conversion", "optimization", "testing" in titles
4. Process visual-heavy sections separately with image analysis

### Error Handling
- If extraction returns too few items, prompt for deeper analysis
- If quality is low, re-run with validation prompt
- For complex visuals, use dedicated image analysis prompt

### Optimization
- Combine related pages (introduction + principle + case study)
- Use chapter summary for high-level overview first
- Then drill down with specific extraction prompts
- Cross-reference extractions for consistency

### Rate Limiting
- Process maximum 5 API calls per minute
- Allow 2-second delays between calls
- Monitor response quality vs. speed
- Prioritize quality over quantity
