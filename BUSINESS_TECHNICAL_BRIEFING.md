async createPaymentIntent(amount: number, currency: string, customerId: string) {
  return await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: amount * 100, // Convert to cents
    currency: currency,
    customer: customerId,
    metadata: { persona: userPersona, product: productId }
  });
}
```

### Email Automation
```typescript
// SMTP Service Configuration

  host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
  port: process.env.SMTP_PORT,
  secure: true,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
    pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS
  }
});
```

// Google Analytics 4
gtag('config', process.env.GA_MEASUREMENT_ID, {
  page_title: document.title,
  page_location: window.location.href,
  custom_map: { 'persona': 'custom_persona_type' }
});
```

### Database Schema (Drizzle ORM)
```typescript
// Key Tables
export const leads = sqliteTable('leads', {
  id: integer('id').primaryKey(),
  email: text('email').notNull(),
  firstName: text('first_name'),
  persona: text('persona'), // JSON stored persona data
  quizAnswers: text('quiz_answers'), // JSON quiz responses
  utmSource: text('utm_source'),
  createdAt: text('created_at').default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`)
});

export const analytics = sqliteTable('analytics', {
  id: integer('id').primaryKey(),
  sessionId: text('session_id'),
  event: text('event').notNull(),
  data: text('data'), // JSON event data
  createdAt: text('created_at').default(sql`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`)
});
```

3. Missing error boundaries in React components
4. Incomplete input validation on some endpoints
5. No rate limiting on API endpoints
```

### Performance Bottlenecks
- **Database**: SQLite not suitable for high traffic (migrate to PostgreSQL)
- **Asset Loading**: No CDN implementation for static assets
- **Bundle Size**: Some components could be code-split for better loading
- **Caching**: No Redis caching layer for database queries

### Security Enhancements Needed

- **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers for XSS protection

## 12. SCALING CHALLENGES & ARCHITECTURAL LIMITS

### Current Limitations
- **Single Server Architecture**: No horizontal scaling capability
- **SQLite Database**: File-based database limits concurrent access
- **No Load Balancing**: Single point of failure
- **Session Storage**: In-memory sessions don't persist across restarts

### Scaling Solutions Required
```
Current: Single Server + SQLite
         ↓
Phase 1: Load Balancer + PostgreSQL + Redis
         ↓
Phase 2: Microservices + Database Clustering
         ↓
Phase 3: Kubernetes + Multi-Region Deployment
```

### Infrastructure Recommendations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with read replicas
- **Caching**: Redis cluster for sessions and frequently accessed data
- **CDN**: CloudFlare or AWS CloudFront for global asset delivery
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and alerting
- **Backup**: Automated database backups and disaster recovery
